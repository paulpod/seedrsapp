# Table Slider

A component which mimics the open-shut table cell effect seen in mobile interfaces.

## Available Settings

You can specify icons for up to three buttons along with colors and labels. You can also adjust button width and cell border.

The buttons are ordered from right to left: Glyph 1, Color 1 and Label 1 apply to the rightmost button. 

The component only displays a button if its glyph is set to something other than "none." Color and label controls are likewise hidden if the button is assigned no glyph.

## Linking the Table Cell

Click on the purple dot that appears at the right edge of the table cell and you can draw out a connection to any other frame in your project. That frame will then appear as the table cell's content.

## Adding Interactions

The buttons in Table Slider will look for functions attached to the `Data` object. Add these to your `App.ts` file below the initialization. [It'll look something like `const data = Data(...`]

```
Data.sliderButton1 = () => {
    console.log("1")
}

Data.sliderButton2 = () => {
    console.log("2")
}

Data.sliderButton3 = () => {
    console.log("3")
}
```

Then replace the `console.log()` statements with whatever you like.

## Changes

- **1.6** Slider buttons can be tied to functions
- **1.5** Added customizable cell borders
